# Crawlee Cloud Dashboard

Next.js web UI for monitoring and managing your self-hosted [Crawlee Cloud](https://crawlee.cloud) instance.

## What's inside

- **Actors** — list, create, edit, and inspect actor versions and builds
- **Runs** — start runs, watch live logs over WebSocket, browse outputs
- **Datasets** — paginated browser with JSON/CSV export
- **Key-Value Stores** — inspect and edit values inline
- **Request Queues** — list pending and handled requests with locking state
- **Builds** — track build history and active version per actor
- **Schedules** — cron-style scheduled runs
- **Webhooks** — configure event-driven notifications
- **Runners** — view connected runners, capacity, and recent assignments
- **Settings** — API tokens, users, and instance configuration

Built with Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4, and Radix UI primitives.

## Development

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev --workspace=@crawlee-cloud/dashboard
```

The dashboard runs at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and talks to the API server at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`).

| `NEXTAUTH_URL`        | Public URL of the dashboard (used for callback URLs) |

## Deployment
