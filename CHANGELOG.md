## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed

- **Runner: actor containers can now reach a host-running API on macOS dev setups.** When the runner runs on the host (the default `npm run dev` flow on a Mac) and spawns an actor container with `APIFY_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`, the actor previously failed because `localhost` inside the container is the container itself, not the host. The runner now auto-translates `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` to `host.docker.internal` on `os.platform() === 'darwin'` only — Linux is untouched, since `host.docker.internal` doesn't resolve there by default and production Linux deploys typically use a real service hostname. A one-time warning logs the rewrite so operators understand what's happening.
- **Scaler: heartbeats now match by runner _name_ as a fallback, not just _id_.** Cloud-init can't always set `RUNNER_ID` to the provider id at boot (curl to the metadata service can fail, or the user-data path is racy). When that happens, the runner publishes its heartbeat keyed on `os.hostname()` — which providers typically set to the runner _name_ (DO droplet name, local-docker container name), not the id. Previously the scaler matched only by id and ip, so every healthy runner was marked dead after the reaper threshold and destroyed. Lookup is now `id → ip → name`. The DO cloud-init also opportunistically queries the metadata service for the droplet id and writes `RUNNER_ID=<id>` so the primary match works whenever the metadata fetch succeeds.
- **Local-docker provider: strip the leading `/` from container names** so the value matches what `os.hostname()` returns inside the container (Docker prefixes `Names[0]` with `/`).

### Added

- **API: `GET /v2/actor-runs/:runId/log` (Apify-compat alias).** Returns the same plain-text payload as the canonical `/logs/raw` route. Apify's documented public endpoint is the singular form; tools like `apify-client` and curl scripts targeting `api.apify.com` now work unchanged when pointed at a self-hosted instance.

### Documentation

- `.env.example` now covers `API_BASE_URL` with explicit guidance for macOS dev (auto-translation), docker-compose (service name), and production (public DNS).

### Tests

- Added `packages/runner/test/translate.test.ts` covering Darwin auto-translation, Linux pass-through, and non-loopback hosts. Runner package now has a `test` script wired to vitest.
- Added `/log` alias coverage in `packages/api/test/logs.test.ts` — verifies it returns identical bytes to `/logs/raw` and shares the same ownership 404 gate.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-01

### Security

- **Scaler: TLS verification is no longer disabled by default on provisioned runners.** Previously `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` was hard-coded into the cloud-init script, making every outbound HTTPS call from a runner (API, S3, registries, actor scraping) MITM-vulnerable. The bypass is now opt-in via `SCALER_INSECURE_TLS=true`, and the API logs a startup warning when set. Operators relying on internal CAs / self-signed certs must explicitly opt in; otherwise upgrade is transparent.
- Documented the cloud-init userData secret-exposure caveat: on `digitalocean` provider, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and registry tokens are inlined into user_data and readable from the DO metadata service by anything running on the VM. Tracked for an architectural fix in a future release; documented today so operators can apply network-level mitigations.

### Performance

- Replaced `redis.keys('runner:heartbeat:*')` with cursor-based `SCAN` in both `getActiveRunners` and `getScalerStatus`. `KEYS` is O(N) over the entire keyspace and blocks the Redis event loop — fine in tests, lethal on a shared Redis at scale.

### Fixed

- Scaler no longer over-provisions on transient `provider.listRunners()` failures. Previously the error was swallowed and an empty list returned, causing the scaler to think capacity was zero and create duplicate runners on the next tick. Errors now propagate to the loop's catch block, which logs and skips the tick.
- `loadScalerConfig` rejects non-finite integer env vars (e.g. `SCALER_MAX_RUNNERS=abc`) and falls back to defaults instead of producing `NaN` and silently breaking comparisons. `MAX_RUNNERS` is also clamped to `>= MIN_RUNNERS`.
- `LAST_ACTIVITY_KEY` now has a TTL (4× `idleTimeoutSecs`) so it ages out of Redis if the scaler is later disabled, rather than living forever.
- `RUNNERS_KEY` TTL adapts to `pollIntervalSecs` (`max(120, pollIntervalSecs * 4)`). Previously hard-coded to 120s, which caused `getScalerStatus` to report an empty runner list when the poll interval exceeded 30s.

### Documentation

- Added an Auto-scaling section to `docs/runner.md` covering every `SCALER_*` env var, provider matrix, and operational notes.
- `.env.example` and `.env.secure.example` now document the full scaler config surface, with `SCALER_INSECURE_TLS` and `METRICS_PUBLIC` flagged as security opt-outs.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-01

### Breaking

- `GET /metrics` is now admin-only by default. Previously unauthenticated, the endpoint exposed process internals and per-route HTTP counters useful for fingerprinting a deployment. Self-hosted operators scraping `/metrics` with Prometheus must update their scrape config to send an admin JWT (or admin API key) in the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header. `/health`, `/health/live`, and `/health/ready` remain unauthenticated for k8s probes. Set `METRICS_PUBLIC=true` to opt out (see Added below).
- `GET /v2/scaler/status` is now admin-only with no opt-out — the response includes runner IPs, cloud provider, and scaler config that have no public use case.

### Added

- **Auto-scaling**: new `local-docker` scaler provider for development and small self-hosted setups; reaper sweeps dead runners; image registry support (GHCR, Docker Hub) so new runners pull actor images on demand instead of requiring a local build.
- **Build versioning**: actor versions and builds are tracked separately, with a partial unique index on `actor_versions(actor_id, build_tag)` to allow multiple builds per tag while keeping the active one unique.
- **Run pagination**: scale-aware, stable pagination for run listings — keyset-based, holds steady under high write volume.
- **CLI profiles**: `crc login --profile <name>` saves named credential sets; `crc profile list/use/rm` and `CRAWLEE_CLOUD_PROFILE=...` env override let you switch between local/staging/prod without re-logging-in.
- **CLI `crc info`**: shows active profile, API URL, server reachability, and authenticated user. Exits non-zero on failure — usable as a CI gate.
- **Actor default env vars and image** in `defaultRunOptions` — set per-actor defaults that apply to every run unless overridden at run time.
- **Dashboard pages**: Builds, Schedules, Webhooks, Request Queues, Runners, Key-Value Store browser, mobile nav, toast/dialog/confirm UI primitives.
- `METRICS_PUBLIC` env var (default `false`) — opt-in escape hatch for operators running Prometheus on a private network where the scrape job can't pass an `Authorization` header. When `METRICS_PUBLIC=true` and `NODE_ENV=production`, the API logs a startup warning. There is intentionally no equivalent flag for `/v2/scaler/status`.

### Changed

- Documentation moved from the website repo to `docs/` in this repo as the source of truth, with sync to the public site.
- Dashboard migrated to Tailwind v4 utility names (`bg-signal`, `text-fail`, ...) and a unified warm-orange `--signal` color across themes.
- ESLint: pedantic rules softened, real-bug rules kept strict.

### Fixed

- `apify-client` 404 contract: API responses now include `error.type='record-not-found'` so `catchNotFoundOrThrow` correctly falls through to `getOrCreate`.
- Runner API key is regenerated when bound to a stale user, fixing a 404-on-own-storage failure mode after admin changes.
- `PUT /v2/acts/:id` now persists `defaultRunOptions`, `maxRetries`, and `retryDelaySecs` correctly.
- Dataset items return type narrowed at the consumer rather than the helper, unblocking dashboard CI.
- Runner prefixes `actor-` when pulling from a configured registry, matching the build naming convention.
